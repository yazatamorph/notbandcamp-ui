    "Here's some information about the album. It was mainly recorded in Portland, OR, but vocals and finishing touches were tracked in Aldie, VA. Andy of Ca√Øna said it was my best work to date, which was pretty nice of him. The last track is sort of a reharmonized cover of a Kesha b-side from her \"Warrior\" record; I'm not sure it's recognizable, though.",
